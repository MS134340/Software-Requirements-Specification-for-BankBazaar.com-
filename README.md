# Software-Requirements-Specification-for-BankBazaar.com-
This project was developed as part of my Software Engineering coursework to understand and document a real-world system using software engineering principles.

## 📌 Project Summary

The system simulates core banking functionalities like:
- User Login & Authentication
- Balance Inquiry
- Transaction History (up to 1 year)
- Fund Transfer with Validation
- Online Bill Payment
- Cheque Book Allotment

## 🧪 Relevance to Software Testing

This SRS was designed keeping **testability** and **modular design** in mind:
- Functional and Non-Functional Requirements outlined
- DFDs and Process Specifications help map end-to-end test cases
- Identified edge cases and boundary conditions for test planning
- Security and access control mechanisms considered from testing perspective

## 🛠️ Technologies / Tools (planned or assumed)
- Frontend: HTML
- Backend: JSP
- Database: MS Access / SQL Server
- Interfaces: Web browser (IE 6+, Firefox)
- Testing Scope: Manual test case mapping based on requirements

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied
- Requirement Gathering and Analysis
- Functional Decomposition
- User Roles and Access Flow
- System Modeling with Diagrams
- Secure Design Principles

## 📚 Academic Context
This was a standalone academic project and not deployed live. The focus was on requirement engineering, design, and theoretical test planning.
